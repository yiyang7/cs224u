    "1. If you're working on an established problem, then you'll feel pressure from readers (and referees) to use the metrics that have already been used for the problem. This might be a compelling pressure. However, you should always feel free to argue against those cultural norms and motivate new ones. Areas can stagnate due to poor metrics, so we must be vigilant!\n",
