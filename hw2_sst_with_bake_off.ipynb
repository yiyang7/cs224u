    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework and associated bake-off are devoted to the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST). The homework questions ask you to implement some baseline systems, and the bake-off challenge is to define a system that does extremely well at the SST task.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll focus on the ternary task as defined by `sst.ternary_class_func`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SST test set will be used for the bake-off evaluation. This dataset is already publicly distributed, so we are counting on people not to cheat by develping their models on the test set. You must do all your development without using the test set at all, and then evaluate exactly once on the test set and turn in the results, with no further system tuning or additional runs. __Much of the scientific integrity of our field depends on people adhering to this honor code__. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our only additional restriction is that __you cannot make any use of the subtree labels__. This corresponds to the 'Root' condition in the paper. As we discussed in class, the subtree labels are a really interesting feature of SST, but bringing them in results in a substantially different learning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of our goals for this homework and bake-off is to encourage you to engage in __the basic development cycle for supervised models__, in which you\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a new feature function. We recommend starting with something simple.\n",
    "1. Use `sst.experiment` to evaluate your new feature function, with at least `fit_softmax_classifier`.\n",
    "1. If you have time, compare your feature function with `unigrams_phi` using `sst.compare_models` or `sst.compare_models_mcnemar`. (For discussion, see [this notebook section](sst_02_hand_built_features.ipynb#Statistical-comparison-of-classifier-models).)\n",
    "1. Return to step 1, or stop the cycle and conduct a more rigorous evaluation with hyperparameter tuning and assessment on the `dev` set.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Error analysis](#Error-analysis) is one of the most important methods for steadily improving a system, as it facilitates a kind of human-powered hill-climbing on your ultimate objective. Often, it takes a careful human analyst just a few examples to spot a major pattern that can lead to a beneficial change to the feature representations."

    "### A more powerful vector-summing baseline [3 points]\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Distributed representations as features](sst_03_neural_networks.ipynb#Distributed-representations-as-features), we looked at a baseline for the ternary SST problem in which each example is modeled as the sum of its 50-dimensional GloVe representations. A `LogisticRegression` model was used for prediction. A neural network might do better here, since there might be complex relationships between the input feature dimensions that a linear classifier can't learn. \n",
    "\n",
    "To address this question, rerun the experiment with `torch_shallow_neural_classifier.TorchShallowNeuralClassifier` as the classifier. Specs:\n",
    "* Use `sst.experiment` to conduct the experiment. \n",
    "* Using 3-fold cross-validation, exhaustively explore this set of hyperparameter combinations:\n",
    "  * The hidden dimensionality at 50, 100, and 200.\n",
    "  * The hidden activation function as `nn.Tanh` or `nn.ReLU`.\n",
    "* (For all other parameters to `TorchShallowNeuralClassifier`, use the defaults.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, submit code to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Your model wrapper function around `TorchShallowNeuralClassifier`. This function should implement the requisite cross-validation; see [this notebook section](sst_02_hand_built_features.ipynb#Hyperparameter-search) for examples.\n",
    "1. Your average F1 score according to `sst.experiment`. \n",
    "2. The optimal hyperparameters chosen in your experiment. (You can just paste in the dict that `sst._experiment` prints.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We're not evaluating the quality of your model. (We've specified the protocols completely, but there will still be a  lot of variation in the results.) However, the primary goal of this question is to get you thinking more about this strikingly good baseline feature representation scheme for SST, so we're sort of hoping you feel compelled to try out variations on your own."

    "### Your original system [4 points]\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to develop an original model for the SST ternary problem. There are many options. If you spend more than a few hours on this homework problem, you should consider letting it grow into your final project! Here are some relatively manageable ideas that you might try:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We didn't systematically evaluate the `bidirectional` option to the `TorchRNNClassifier`. Similarly, that model could be tweaked to allow multiple LSTM layers (at present there is only one), and you could try adding layers to the classifier portion of the model as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We've already glimpsed the power of rich initial word representations, and later in the course we'll see that smart initialization usually leads to a performance gain in NLP, so you could perhaps achieve a winning entry with a simple model that starts in a great place.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The [practical introduction to contextual word representations](contextualreps.ipynb) (to be discussed later in the quarter) covers pretrained representations and interfaces that are likely to boost the performance of any system.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `TreeNN` and `TorchTreeNN` don't perform all that well, and this could be for the same reason that RNNs don't peform well: the gradient signal doesn't propagate reliably down inside very deep trees. [Tai et al. 2015](https://aclanthology.info/papers/P15-1150/p15-1150) sought to address this with TreeLSTMs, which are fairly easy to implement in PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the [distributed representations as features](#Distributed-representations-as-features) section, we just summed  all of the leaf-node GloVe vectors to obtain a fixed-dimensional representation for all sentences. This ignores all of the tree structure. See if you can do better by paying attention to the binary tree structure: write a function `glove_subtree_phi` that obtains a vector representation for each subtree by combining the vectors of its daughters, with the leaf nodes again given by GloVe (any dimension you like) and the full representation of the sentence given by the final vector obtained by this recursive process. You can decide on how you combine the vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. If you have a lot of computing resources, then you can fire off a large hyperparameter search over many parameter values. All the model classes for this course are compatible with the `scikit-learn` and [scikit-optimize](https://scikit-optimize.github.io) methods, because they define the required functions for getting and setting parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to emphasize that this needs to be an __original__ system. It doesn't suffice to download code from the Web, retrain, and submit. You can build on others' code, but you have to do something new and meaningful with it.\n",
    "\n",
